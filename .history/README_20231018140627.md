v1.2 2023.10.12 - Changed temp jog buttons to slider.  
                  Set hold mode on temp change.  
                  Changes to tstat_main.html and tstst_scheduler.php to 
                  validate HTML successfully.

v1.1 2023.09.29 - Finished mode/fan buttons.  Added new graphing.  Bugfixes.

===== About =================================================================
   This project is to provide a web interface for the Radio Thermostat CT-30, CT-50, CT80, and 3M50  thermostats.
   
   As of May 15, 2023, the official Radio Thermostat web app is being 
   discontinued.  With this, we all lost the web interface, history logging, 
   etc, that their site provided.   This project is to give you that same 
   functionality.  I did ask them for the site code, so I could match 
   their old look and feel.  They declined. So this is all new code.

   It project provides:

   * Web interface that you can place on a local server. 
     * Ability to set the temp
     * Ability to set the schedule
     * Ability to change HVAC mode and fan mode
     * Display of current information.
   * MRTG graphing of the current temperature and target temperature
   * MQTT publish current temperature for other MQTT nodes to use.

===== Requirements ==========================================================

   1) One of the supported Radio Thermstat thermostats:
      Radio Thermostat CT-30, CT-50, CT80, and 3M50

   2) A web server that supports PHP, that is on the same network.  
      A RPi or similar would be more than sufficient.  Even an old desktop 
      PC running Linux would be fine.  

      PHP will require CURL and SQLite3, but those should be standard.
      
   3) phpMQTT for the MQTT publish function if so desired.  
      https://github.com/bluerhinos/phpMQTT
      
   4) MRTG installed on host, if you want graphing.

   5) Cron or similar scheduler, if you want graphing to work.

===== Files ================================================================= 
   mrtg.thermostat.conf - MRTG configuration file, for temp/target graph
   phpMQTT.php          - MQTT library from https://github.com/bluerhinos/phpMQTT
   tstat_api_gw.php     - PHP to send API requests directly to the thermostat
   tstat_gloabls.php    - Global variables used by the PHP files.
   tstat_info.php       - A dump of all the API calls supported by the thermostat.  
                          This is slow, but is only used for developing new features.
   tstat_main.html      - The main page.  You should copy this to index.html
   tstat_multi.php      - Display of graphs for day/week/month/year
   tstat_poll.php       - This is run by the cron to update thermostat data,
                          generate MRTG graphs, push info out to MQTT, etc.
   tstat_rebuild_db.php - Rebuild the SQLite DB from the CSV file(s).  You 
                          shouldn't ever need this, unless the DB gets corrupted.
   tstat_scheduler.php  - Editor for the thermostat scheduler.
   tstat_temp_graph.php - This generates the graphs for display, from the DB.
   ./docs/              - This directory contains the user manual for the 
                          Radio Thermostat CT-50, CT80, 3M50, and CT-30, as 
                          well as the API doc that I found a while back.  
                          If there is a more recent version of the API doc, 
                          I would appreciate getting a copy.
   ./images/            - Some images for the web interface
   ./data/              - MRTG data
===== Installation ==========================================================
   1) Copy the files for this package to a directory on your local web server.  
   The web server *must* be on the same network segment.  These thermostats
   do not have *ANY* security to them.  There is no authentication for API 
   calls.  Do *NOT* ever put this thermostat directly facing the Internet. 
   
   I installed it on my custom firewall (Linux server), on the web interface
   that is only accessible by the LAN. (bound to 192.168.1.0:80 :443, not 
   0.0.0.0:80 :433)
                          
   2) Modify the tstat_globals.php file to match your installation. 
   
   3) Browse to it, and see that it works.
   
   4) Set the crons (below) as necessary for automated tasks.  The scheduler
   itself runs automatically on the thermostat.  There is nothing more to do for that.

   5) You may want to symlink tstat_main.html to index.html, if you don't have
   anything else in the folder.
   
===== Cron ==================================================================

   To get the graphing, we need to poll the thermostat at regular intervals, 
   and record the data in the csv, db, or optionally mrtg and mqtt. 
   
   This is in the standard Linux/Unix cron format.  Fix your paths for your 
   machine's paths. If you are running this on a Windows machine, you'll need 
   to make the appropriate entry in Task Scheduler. 

   You can set the interval to anything you want.  More frequent polling gives
   better resolution on your graphs.  5 minutes (*/5) is what many people use.
   1 minute (*/1) seems to overload the thermostat on occasion, so I don't 
   recommend 1 minute.
